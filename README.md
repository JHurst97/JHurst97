### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**JHurst97/JHurst97** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a steganography program. Steganography allows you to manipulate the bits within a file to covertly store data.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java-based design in Processing.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaboration.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any of my projects!
