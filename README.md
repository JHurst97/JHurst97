### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a steganography program. Steganography allows you to manipulate the bits within a file to covertly store data, basically my program allows you to type a message or input an image and it stores it within a cover image. For a quick overview of steganography - numberphile have made  <a href=https://youtu.be/TWEXCYQKyDc>a very informative video</a>.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Processing, a Java-based programming language.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any of my projects!
